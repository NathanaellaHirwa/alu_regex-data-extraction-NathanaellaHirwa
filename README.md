# alu_regex-data-extraction-NathanaellaHirwa
This Python script reads text from a file (index1.txt) and uses regular expressions to extract common data patterns, including:

Email addresses

URLs

Phone numbers

Credit card numbers

HTML tags

Hashtags

Currency amounts

Times (12-hour and 24-hour format)

Each pattern has its own function, and results are printed to the console. It's useful for data cleaning, web scraping, and text analysis. The script also handles missing files gracefully and is easy to extend with new patterns.
